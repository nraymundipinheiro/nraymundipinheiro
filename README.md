I'm Natália! ☺️

I'm a master's student at the [State University of New York at Stony Brook](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). I study Physics & Astronomy and I just love a good coding project. I like doing data analysis and simulation stuff, and I plan to get into a doctorate program next year where I can do more of it!
