I'm NatÃ¡lia! I'm a master's student at the (State University of New York at Stony Brook)[https://www.stonybrook.edu/]. I study Physics & Astronomy and I just love a good coding project. I like doing data analysis and simulation stuff, and I plan to get into a doctorate program next year where I can do more of it!
